# Wake_Model_in_ABL_Flows
Compute steady-state wake structure behind yawed or unyawed wind turbines in ABL flows with wind veer and thermal stratification effects.

Wake model implementation is based on the following publication:

Ghanesh Narasimhan, Dennice F. Gayme, Charles Meneveau; An extended analytical wake model and applications to yawed wind turbines in atmospheric boundary layers with different levels of stratification and veer. J. Renewable Sustainable Energy 1 May 2025; 17 (3): 033302. https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0251305
